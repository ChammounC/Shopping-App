# Shopping App

This App is more focused upon the various Authentication methods provided by Firebase such as SignIn and SignUp with Phone Number, Email, Google and Facebook.
## What I Learned

- Update UI according to the user information such as Phone Number and User Location.
- Enable Location access of the phone
- Better understanding of Firebase Console
